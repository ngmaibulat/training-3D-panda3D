Certainly! Here's a revised study program outline that incorporates Panda3D for 3D programming:

Course Title: Introduction to 3D Programming with Panda3D

Course Duration: 8 weeks (2 hours per week)

Week 1: Introduction to 3D Programming and Panda3D

- Overview of 3D programming concepts and applications
- Introduction to Panda3D game engine and its features
- Setting up the development environment with Panda3D

Week 2: Coordinate Systems and Transformation Matrices

- Understanding 3D coordinate systems (world, model, view, and projection)
- Introduction to transformation matrices (translation, rotation, scaling)
- Implementing basic transformations using Panda3D's built-in functions

Week 3: Loading and Manipulating 3D Models

- Importing 3D models in common formats (e.g., OBJ, FBX) into Panda3D
- Working with mesh geometry and manipulating vertices
- Applying transformations to 3D models in Panda3D

Week 4: Texturing and Materials

- Introduction to texture mapping and material properties
- Applying textures to 3D models in Panda3D
- Adjusting material properties (diffuse, specular, ambient) for realistic rendering

Week 5: Lighting and Shading

- Understanding different lighting models (ambient, diffuse, specular) in Panda3D
- Implementing lighting calculations for 3D scenes
- Exploring shading techniques (flat, Gouraud, Phong) in Panda3D

Week 6: Cameras and Viewports

- Setting up cameras and controlling the view in Panda3D
- Implementing camera movement and rotation
- Working with multiple viewports for split-screen or multi-camera setups

Week 7: Collision Detection and Physics

- Introduction to collision detection algorithms in Panda3D
- Implementing basic collision detection and response
- Introducing physics simulation using Panda3D's physics engine capabilities

Week 8: Advanced Topics and Project Work

- Advanced rendering techniques in Panda3D (shadows, reflections, post-processing effects)
- Exploring Panda3D's scripting capabilities for game logic and interactivity
- Final project: Building a 3D game or interactive application using Panda3D

Please note that this outline is a general framework, and you can adapt it based on the needs and progress of your course. You can provide additional resources, such as tutorials and sample projects, to support the learning process and encourage exploration beyond the outlined topics.
